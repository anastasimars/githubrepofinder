# GitHubRepoFinder API
The GitHubRepoFinder API allows users to retrieve repository information from GitHub, including the list of branches and the latest commit SHA for each branch.

## Before Starting
Before running the project, make sure you have installed on your system:
- Java 21 
- Maven 

## Setup
If you have completed the previous steps, you can start cloning the project to your computer:
1. Navigate to the main page of the repository
2. Click  <> Code button
3. Clone the project:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/anastasimars/githubrepofinder.git
```

4. Navigate to the directory where youâ€™d like your cloned directory to appear. Use the cd command to change the directory:

```sh
$ cd '/c/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/My Project'
```

5. Build with Maven: 

```sh
mvn clean install
```
6. Run the application:

```

## Features
- Fetch repositories for a given GitHub username
- List branches for each repository, excluding forks
- Error handling for cases where the username is not found

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with it using HTTP requests. The primary endpoint is:

GET /api/github/users/{username}/repos

Example usage:
To fetch repositories for a user named jakubnabrdalik, send a GET request to:

```sh
http://localhost:8080/api/github/users/jakubnabrdalik/repos
```
This will return a JSON response containing the repositories and their branches for the specified user.

# Error Handling
404 Not Found: If the username does not exist, the API returns a UsernameNotFoundException.

## Test
The GitHubRepoFinder API includes integration test to ensure the application works as expected. This test use RestAssured and JUnit to validate the API endpoints. The test is located in the src/test/java directory.
